//! Guard: encoding one large page at the `Photo` profile must not hold its
//! input wavelet planes whole (#812, PERF_EXPERIMENTS.md ENCODE_BANDED_PLANES).
//!
//! `encode_iw44_color` used to build three full-resolution `i16` planes,
//! transform them, and gather them into three dense block grids of the same
//! size — six `page_bytes` at once, where `page_bytes` is `w * h * 2`, one
//! plane. The grid has to stay: every slice walks every block. The planes do
//! not: a page above the banding threshold now transforms one band of block
//! rows at a time, so the encoder holds the grid, the sparse reconstruction
//! mirror and one band. That is three `page_bytes` and a little; the ceiling
//! below is four. The subject measures about 3.5 and measured 6.2 before.
//!
//! The subject is a synthetic page of the largest fixture's size
//! (`big-scanned-page.djvu`, 6780x9148), the one page in the corpus that
//! crosses the threshold. It is drawn, not rendered: rendering that fixture
//! costs 40 s in a debug build and belongs to the render guards, while the
//! peak this guard measures depends on the page's size, not its content. A
//! `Photo` encode of it takes a few seconds in release and under a minute in
//! debug, so there is no warm-up encode; first-touch allocations are
//! kilobytes against a margin of tens of megabytes.
//!
//! The whole measurement is one `#[test]` on purpose. The allocator counters
//! below are process-global and `cargo test` runs a binary's tests on parallel
//! threads, so a second test in this file would count the first one's
//! allocations. Do not add one.
