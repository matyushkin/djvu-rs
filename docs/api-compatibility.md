# API compatibility, stability, and resource-limit policy

This document is the checked-in, enforceable contract for consumers of the
`djvu-rs` crate and its workspace codec crates (`djvu-iff`, `djvu-bzz`,
`djvu-jb2`, `djvu-iw44`, `djvu-zp`, `djvu-bitmap`, `djvu-pixmap`). It defines:

- what "stable", "experimental", and "deprecated" mean for this project;
- the semantic-versioning and deprecation-window rules;
- the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) policy;
- the supported feature combinations and build targets
  (see also [`feature-matrix.md`](feature-matrix.md));
- the `Send`/`Sync` and thread-safety expectations of the public types;
- the panic-free contract for untrusted input;
- the resource-limit (memory / work / decompression) contract and how limit
  failures surface as typed errors.

It is enforced in CI. See [Enforcement](#enforcement) for the exact gates.

> **Pre-1.0 note.** The crate is currently `0.x`. Under Cargo's SemVer rules a
> `0.MINOR.PATCH` release treats **MINOR** as the breaking-change axis and
> **PATCH** as the compatible axis. Everything below is written so it reads the
> same way once the crate reaches `1.0`; until then, substitute "minor bump"
> for "major bump" wherever a breaking change is described.

## 1. Surface tiers

Every public item belongs to exactly one tier. The tier is declared in the
item's rustdoc and, where a whole area is involved, gated behind a Cargo
feature whose name signals the tier.

### Stable

The default surface. Stable items follow SemVer: a breaking change to their
signature, behavior, or error contract requires a major bump (pre-1.0: a minor
bump). This includes:

- `Document`, `Page`, and the crate-root re-exports of the document model
  (`DjVuDocument`, `DjVuPage`, `DjVuBookmark`, `PageInfo`, `Rotation`,
  `ComponentId`, `ComponentKind`, …).
- The error hierarchy (`DjVuError`, `IffError`, `Jb2Error`, `Iw44Error`,
  `BzzError`, `DocError`, `RenderError`) — see the error-stability rule below.
- The rendering entry points in [`djvu_render`] (`RenderOptions`,
  `render_pixmap`, `render_region`, `render_coarse`, `render_progressive`, …).
- The codec entry points of the workspace crates that the README advertises as
  `no_std`-callable: `iff::parse_form`, `bzz::bzz_decode`, `jb2::decode_dict`,
  `iw44::Iw44Image::decode_chunk`.
- The text / annotation / metadata parsers and their data models.
- The writer surfaces behind their feature gates (`pdf`, `epub`, `cbz`,
  `tiff`): once a `djvu_to_*` entry point ships, its signature is stable.

**Error stability rule.** Error *enums* are `#[non_exhaustive]` in spirit:
consumers must not rely on the absence of variants, and adding a new variant is
a compatible change. Renaming or removing an existing variant, or changing the
data it carries, is breaking. Matching on a stable variant and reading its
documented fields is supported.

### Experimental

Opt-in, may change or be removed in any release **including a patch release**,
and is excluded from the API-breakage gate. Experimental status is signalled
two ways, both of which must be present:

- the rustdoc opens with a bolded `**Experimental:**` note explaining the
  instability, and
- the surface is reachable only behind an experimental feature flag.

Current experimental features: `experimental`, `iw44-probe`, `alloc-profile`,
`ocr-onnx`, `wasm-threads`. Current experimental/placeholder items:
`ocr-neural` (`CandleBackend` — `load()` returns an unsupported error and there
is no stable model contract). These are **out of scope** for API freezing per
issue #695 and remain free to change.

### Deprecated

Still stable and still shipped, but scheduled for removal. A deprecated item:

- carries `#[deprecated(since = "x.y.z", note = "use … instead")]` on code
  items, or an explicit "Deprecated" marker in its rustdoc / the feature table
  for feature-level aliases;
- keeps working, unchanged, for the **deprecation window** below;
- names its replacement.

**Deprecation window.** A deprecated item remains available for at least **two
minor releases** after the release that introduced the deprecation, and never
less than **90 days**, whichever is longer. Removal happens only in a
breaking (major; pre-1.0 minor) release.

Current deprecated surfaces:

| Item | Kind | Replacement |
|------|------|-------------|
| `bzz_new` module | re-export alias | `bzz` |
| `iw44_new` module | re-export alias | `iw44` |
| `ocr-neural-candle` feature | no-op feature alias | `ocr-neural` |

These aliases are kept intentionally cheap (a `pub use` or a no-op feature) so
they can outlive the minimum window without cost.

## 2. Semantic versioning

- **Patch** (`0.y.Z`): bug fixes, performance work, new **stable** APIs that are
  purely additive, new error variants, new features that default to off.
- **Minor** (`0.Y.z`, pre-1.0 = breaking): removals of deprecated items after
  their window, signature/behavior changes to stable items, MSRV raises.
- Experimental surfaces are exempt: they may break in any release.

Unintended breakage of the **stable** surface is caught by
[`cargo-semver-checks`](#enforcement) in CI, which compares the PR against the
latest published version and understands the `0.x` breaking axis.

## 3. Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

- MSRV is **Rust 1.88** (edition 2024; let-chains). It is declared in
  `rust-version` in every workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- Raising the MSRV is a **minor** (pre-1.0 breaking) change and is called out in
  the changelog.
- MSRV is a **required** CI gate (the `MSRV (1.88)` job builds the crate on the
  pinned toolchain). A PR that uses a newer-than-MSRV language or std feature
  fails that gate.

## 4. Feature combinations and targets

The supported combinations and build targets, and the CI jobs that keep them
green, are enumerated in [`feature-matrix.md`](feature-matrix.md). The load-
bearing invariants:

- **Decode-only default tree.** The default (`std`) build must not pull in any
  writer/encoder dependency (zip, zopfli, jpeg-encoder, clap, …). Enforced by
  `scripts/check_feature_hygiene.sh` in the required `Lint` gate (#509).
- **`no_std` + `alloc`.** `--no-default-features` must build on the host and on
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and the four codec entry points must be callable
  from a `#![no_std]` consumer (`tests/no_std_smoke`). Required via the
  `Test (stable)` and `wasm32 build check` gates.
- **wasm.** `wasm`, `wasm-lazy`, and `+simd128` all build for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Required via the `wasm32 build check` gate.
- **Additivity.** Enabling any documented feature must not break another
  feature that already built. Any documented combination must compile.

`wasm-threads` is the one documented target deliberately **outside** the
required gate: it needs a nightly toolchain and `-Z build-std`, so it is checked
by the opt-in `make wasm-threads-check` only.

## 5. `Send` / `Sync` and thread-safety

The public types' thread-safety is part of the contract and asserted at compile
time in [`tests/send_sync_contract.rs`](../tests/send_sync_contract.rs); a
regression there is a breaking change and fails CI.

| Type | `Send` | `Sync` | Notes |
|------|:------:|:------:|-------|
| `Document` | ✓ | ✓ | Owns an `Arc<dyn AsRef<[u8]> + Send + Sync>` backing; safe to share across threads. |
| `DjVuDocument` | ✓ | ✓ | The document model; shared-dictionary caches use `Arc<SharedDict>` with interior sync. |
| `Page<'a>` / `DjVuPage` | ✓ | ✓ | Borrow of the parent document; carries no interior mutability observable to callers. |
| `DjVuDocumentMut` / `PageMut<'doc>` | ✓ | — by borrow | The mutable editor is `Send`; a `PageMut` borrows `&mut`, so exclusivity (not `Sync`) is how concurrent edits are prevented. |
| `Pixmap` / `GrayPixmap` / `Bitmap` | ✓ | ✓ | Plain owned pixel buffers. |
| `RenderOptions`, `TextLayer`, `Annotation`, metadata types | ✓ | ✓ | Plain data. |
| `LazyDocument<R>` (async) | ✓/✓ **iff** `R: Send`/`Sync` | conditional | Thread-safety is inherited from the caller-supplied reader `R`. |

**Async guidance.** CPU-bound IW44/JB2 decode and render is synchronous and
must run on a blocking pool (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`), not on a runtime
thread. `Document`/`DjVuDocument` being `Send + Sync` means a single parsed
document can be shared (e.g. behind an `Arc`) across render tasks.

## 6. Panic-free contract for untrusted input

**Contract.** No public parse, decode, or render entry point may panic, abort,
or overflow on *any* byte input, trusted or not. Malformed input must surface as
a typed `Err`, never an unwind. This covers `DjVuDocument::parse` /
`parse_from_dir`, `Document::open` / `from_bytes` / `from_reader`, every
`DjVuPage` accessor (`thumbnail`, `text_layer`, `annotations`, `extract_mask`),
every `djvu_render::*` entry point, and the standalone codec entry points.

**Tests.** The contract is exercised by:

- [`tests/panic_free_corpus.rs`](../tests/panic_free_corpus.rs) — runs every
  public decode/render entry point across the whole corpus and a set of
  adversarial byte patterns on every PR; any unwind fails the run.
- `tests/proptest_codecs.rs` — property tests over the codec surface.
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/*` (libFuzzer) + OSS-Fuzz — continuous adversarial
  coverage of IFF/BZZ/JB2/IW44/G4, encode, metadata, validate, and the full
  parse→render pipeline (`fuzz_full`).

The FFI/WASM boundaries additionally catch unwinds and convert them to error
codes, so a hostile file can never unwind across the language boundary.

## 7. Resource-limit contract

Public decode/render operations **inherit** documented, bounded resource
ceilings: every allocation or loop whose size is driven by untrusted bytes is
capped against an explicit constant or the input length, so a crafted file
costs only bounded memory and work before erroring out. The authoritative table
of ceilings lives in [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md#decode-time-resource-ceilings)
(the #589 inventory) and is summarized here:

| Axis | Bound | Constant |
|------|-------|----------|
| JB2 symbol pixels (per symbol / per stream) | 16 MP / 256 MP | `MAX_SYMBOL_PIXELS` / `MAX_TOTAL_SYMBOL_PIXELS` |
| JB2 page / blit pixels | 16 MP / 256 MP | `MAX_PAGE_SYMBOL_PIXELS` / `MAX_TOTAL_BLIT_PIXELS` |
| JB2 record count | 65 536 | `MAX_RECORDS` |
| IW44 declared image | 64 MP | checked in `decode_chunk` |
| BZZ block / total output | 4 MiB / 256 MB | `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` / `MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE` |
| IFF / FORM nesting depth | 64 | `MAX_IFF_DEPTH` |
| NAVM bookmark depth | 256 | `MAX_NAVM_DEPTH` |
| S-expression (ANTz) depth | 64 | `MAX_SEXPR_DEPTH` |
| Text-zone (TXTz) depth | 64 | `MAX_ZONE_DEPTH` |
| Pixmap pixels | 64 MP | `MAX_PIXELS` |

**Limit failures are typed and identify the operation.** When a ceiling is hit,
the failing codec returns a typed variant that names the axis, and the
`DjVuError` wrapper names the codec/operation:

| Limit | Typed error | Wrapped as |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| IFF nesting too deep | `IffError::DepthLimitExceeded { max }` | `DjVuError::Iff` |
| IFF chunk longer than its container | `IffError::ChunkTooLong { id, claimed, available }` | `DjVuError::Iff` |
| JB2 image / symbol / dict too large | `Jb2Error::ImageTooLarge` / `InheritedDictTooLarge` | `DjVuError::Jb2` |
| JB2 too many records | `Jb2Error::TooManyRecords` | `DjVuError::Jb2` |
| IW44 image too large | `Iw44Error::ImageTooLarge` | `DjVuError::Iw44` |
| BZZ block / output too large | `BzzError::BlockSizeTooLarge(_)` / `OutputTooLarge` | `DjVuError::Bzz` |

The `DjVuError` variant (`Iff` / `Jb2` / `Iw44` / `Bzz`) identifies which
decode stage rejected the input; the inner variant identifies the axis. `IffError::ChunkTooLong` additionally reports the offending chunk `id`.

**Open item (tracked under #695).** These ceilings are compile-time constants
today; a future slice may expose a caller-supplied `ResourceLimits` budget so
consumers can tighten (or, for trusted input, relax) them. The *contract* above
— bounded work, typed operation-identifying errors — is stable regardless of
whether the numbers become configurable.

## 8. Experimental-surface consistency (README ↔ docs.rs)

The set of experimental/placeholder/deprecated surfaces is stated identically
in three places, and they must not drift:

- this document (§1),
- the **Feature flags** and **Status & limitations** tables in the README, and
- the rustdoc of each item (rendered on docs.rs, built with `--all-features` and
  `--cfg docsrs`).
