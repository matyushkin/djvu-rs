//! In-place DjVu document mutation — byte-preserving rewrite of the IFF tree.
//!
//! Originated in [#222](https://github.com/matyushkin/djvu-rs/issues/222).
//! This module parses a document into an editable tree, can walk to a leaf
//! chunk by path, replace its data, and serialise back. When no mutations have
//! happened, [`into_bytes`](crate::djvu_mut::DjVuDocumentMut::into_bytes)
//! returns the original bytes verbatim (byte-identical round-trip). High-level
//! setters are available for page text, annotations, metadata, and bundled-DJVM
//! bookmarks.
//!
//! Indirect `FORM:DJVM` mutation via the plain
//! [`from_bytes`](crate::djvu_mut::DjVuDocumentMut::from_bytes) entry point
//! remains unsupported ([`page_mut`](crate::djvu_mut::DjVuDocumentMut::page_mut)
//! returns [`MutError::IndirectDjvmUnsupported`]). To edit an indirect document,
//! use [`from_indirect_resolved`](crate::djvu_mut::DjVuDocumentMut::from_indirect_resolved),
//! which resolves the external components and rebundles them into an owned
//! bundled `FORM:DJVM` tree; see
//! [`docs/indirect-djvm-mutation.md`](../docs/indirect-djvm-mutation.md). The
//! explicit external-file rewrite path is provided separately by
//! [`IndirectRewritePlan`](crate::djvu_mut::IndirectRewritePlan).
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use djvu_rs::djvu_mut::DjVuDocumentMut;
//!
//! let original = std::fs::read("doc.djvu").unwrap();
//! let mut doc = DjVuDocumentMut::from_bytes(&original).unwrap();
//!
//! // Round-trip byte-identical without edits:
//! assert_eq!(doc.clone().into_bytes(), original);
//!
//! // Replace a leaf chunk's payload by path:
//! doc.replace_leaf(&[0], b"new payload".to_vec()).unwrap();
//! let edited = doc.into_bytes();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Path format
//!
//! A `path: &[usize]` is a sequence of child indices to walk from the root
//! `FORM` chunk. The root itself is never indexed — `[0]` selects the first
//! child of the root.
//!
//! For a single-page `FORM:DJVU`: `[i]` selects the i-th leaf chunk
//! (e.g. `INFO`, `Sjbz`, `BG44`). For a bundled `FORM:DJVM`:
//! `[0]` selects the `DIRM` chunk, `[1]` selects the `NAVM` chunk (if
//! present), `[i]` thereafter selects the i-th component `FORM:DJVU`. To
//! reach a leaf inside that component: `[i, j]`.

/// document **indirect**: each page stays in its own external file, and edits
/// are written back to per-component files in a destination directory.
///
/// The two paths differ deliberately:
///
/// | | `from_indirect_resolved` | `IndirectRewritePlan` |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | Output | one bundled DJVM byte stream | a directory of component files + index |
/// | Side effects | none (`try_into_bytes` returns bytes) | files written on `commit_to_dir` |
/// | Caller policy | none | destination dir, file names, atomicity |
/// | Document shape | becomes bundled | stays indirect |
///
/// # Mutation model
///
/// Edits never touch the filesystem. They are staged in memory via
/// [`Self::edit_page`] / [`Self::set_bookmarks`] and only written when
/// [`Self::commit_to_dir`] is called. Call [`Self::plan`] at any time to
/// preview exactly which files a commit will write and which have changed.
///
/// # Name safety
///
/// Every DIRM component id (and the root index name supplied at commit) must be
/// a safe *flat* relative file name: no path separators, no `.`/`..`, no
/// drive-letter `:`/absolute path, no embedded NUL. Names that could escape the
/// destination directory are rejected with [`MutError::UnsafeComponentName`];
/// two entries mapping to one file name are rejected with
/// [`MutError::DuplicateComponentName`]. Both checks run at construction, so an
/// invalid directory can never reach the write phase. Nested component
/// sub-directories are intentionally not supported by this path.
///
/// # Atomicity
///
/// Each file is written by staging a sibling temporary file in the destination
/// directory and atomically renaming it over the target, so a reader never sees
/// a half-written component file (on platforms where same-directory rename is
/// atomic — POSIX and modern Windows `ReplaceFile`/`rename`). The root index is
/// written **last**.
///
/// What is **not** guaranteed: the multi-file commit is not transactional. A
/// crash partway through can leave some component files updated and others not.
/// Because indirect components are independent, self-describing page files
/// (the index lists names, not byte offsets), every individual file remains a
/// valid DjVu page either way — but the document set as a whole may be a mix of
/// old and new pages until the commit finishes. Callers needing cross-file
/// atomicity should commit to a fresh directory and swap it in themselves.
