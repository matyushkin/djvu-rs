//! Pluggable OCR backend trait and error types.
//!
//! Provides [`OcrBackend`] — an abstraction over OCR engines.
//!
//! Supported user-facing OCR is currently limited to:
//! - `ocr-tesseract` — system Tesseract via `tesseract-rs`.
//!
//! Experimental scaffolding is kept separate and is not exposed as a supported
//! CLI backend:
//! - `ocr-onnx` — generic tract/CTC helper with no stable model contract yet.
//! - `ocr-neural` — placeholder Candle backend; `load()` returns a clear
//!   unsupported-backend error until a concrete model implementation lands.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The trait is a deliberate runtime seam, not a speculative abstraction: the
//! `djvu ocr --backend` CLI selector builds a `Box<dyn OcrBackend>` and drives
//! it polymorphically. It is retained by decision even though only Tesseract is
//! fully wired today. See `docs/ocr-backend-seam.md` (issue #382) for the
//! rationale and the deferred plan for `OcrOptions`.
//!
//! [`OcrBackend`]: crate::ocr::OcrBackend

/// configured through the trait — see `docs/ocr-backend-seam.md`.
